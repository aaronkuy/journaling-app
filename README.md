# Journaling App

## Description
A modern, interactive journaling application that allows users to capture their daily thoughts and experiences. The app features full **CRUD functionality** (Create, Read, Update, Delete). By utilizing **Local Storage**, all entries persist even after refreshing the page or closing the browser. Additionally, it includes a dynamic Dark Mode toggle for a comfortable user experience at any time of day.

## Features
- **Interactive Dialog System:** A modal interface for creating and editing entries that automatically focuses the input field for better UX.
- **Persistent Data:** Full Local Storage integration to ensure user data is never lost.
- **Smart Theme Toggle:** An intelligent Dark/Light mode switcher that remembers the user's preference across sessions.
- **Efficient Editing:** Ability to locate and update specific entries using unique ID references and the spread operator.
- **Responsive UI:** Clean, modern design that is fully optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5** (Semantic elements & Dialog API)
- **JavaScript ES6+** (Array methods, LocalStorage, Event Handling)
- **CSS3** (Flexbox, CSS Variables, Media Queries)
- **Local Storage** (Browser-based persistence)

## The things I've learned
- **Advanced Data Handling:** I mastered how to manage arrays of objects, generate unique IDs via timestamps, and use the Spread Operator to update data immutably.
- **DOM & Event Management:** Deepened my understanding of Event Listeners, specifically handling the `DOMContentLoaded` event and managing modal states.
- **State Logic:** Learned how to use a "switch" variable (like `editingEntryId`) to toggle the entire application's logic between "Create Mode" and "Edit Mode."
- **Professional Debugging:** Gained experience in using the browser console to trace syntax errors and logical bugs in nested functions.
